TL;DR [Install](#Installation)

Terminal interface (TUI) built on top of your existing ~/.ssh/config and native ssh/mosh binaries. No agent or setup needed on remote servers. Features include host filtering/search, editing config in-app, running commands, file transfers, tagging, cloud provider sync, themes, and more. Designed specifically for people who manage many servers (sysadmins, DevOps, SREs).

## Why people use SSM

- **Your SSH config is the source of truth** — SSM reads `~/.ssh/config` (including `Include` directives) and adds the organization you’ve always wanted through simple `#tag:` comments.
- **Fast, reliable discovery at fleet scale** — Filter by tags, fuzzy search, custom ordering, and live reachability checks across all your hosts.
- **One interface for the full loop** — SSH or MOSH connections, ad-hoc command execution, and two-pane SFTP file transfers — all without context switching.
- **Built for people who work the terminal** — Clean, fast, and respectful of how experienced operators actually work.

## How it works with what you already have

Add lightweight metadata to your existing entries:

```ssh-config
Host prod-api
#tag: production,api
    User deploy
    HostName api.example.com
    ...

Host db-primary
#tag: production,database,eu
    User postgres
    HostName db.example.com
    ProxyJump prod-api
```

Then launch SSM:

```bash
ssm                  # see everything
ssm production       # filter to production hosts
ssm db               # or any tag you use
```

No changes are ever made to your remote servers.

### Cloud provider sync

SSM can discover running servers from your cloud providers and write them into your SSH config:

```bash
ssm sync                         # sync all configured providers
ssm sync hetzner aws             # sync specific providers
ssm sync --user deploy --key ~/.ssh/id_ed25519  # set default user and key
ssm sync --dry-run               # preview what would be written
```

Synced hosts are named `{region}-{name}` (e.g. `fsn1-web-01`) and tagged with `#tag: {provider}` so you can filter them with `ssm hetzner`.

Each provider gets its own file under `~/.ssh/config.d/50-ssm-{provider}`. The `Include config.d/*` line in `~/.ssh/config` is added automatically — no manual editing required.

> Credentials are read from environment variables:
> - Hetzner: `HCLOUD_TOKEN`
> - AWS: standard SDK credential chain (env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`, IAM role)
> - GCP: `GCP_PROJECT` + Application Default Credentials
> - Azure: `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` + Azure SDK auth (env vars, Azure CLI, managed identity)

## Key Capabilities

### Discovery & Navigation

| Capability          | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tag-based filtering** | Use `#tag: production,web` in your config and filter instantly with `ssm production` |
| **Fuzzy search**        | Fast search across all hosts with `/`                                       |
| **Live reachability**   | Ping one host or your entire fleet (capped at 50 concurrent) with `p` / `P` |

### Connection & Interaction

| Capability          | Description                                                                 |

| **Remote execution**      | `Ctrl+r` (interactive on selected host) or `ssm [tag] -r 'cmd'` (batch on filtered hosts, non-TTY safe) |
| **Clean exit mode**       | `--exit` flag uses `syscall.Exec` so the process is fully replaced        |

### File Management

| Capability          | Description                                                                 |

### Configuration & Power Tools

| Capability          | Description                                                                 |

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Provider discovery** | Fetch running servers from Hetzner, AWS, GCP, and Azure with `ssm sync`   |
| **Per-provider files** | Each provider written to `~/.ssh/config.d/50-ssm-{provider}`              |
| **Auto-include**        | `Include config.d/*` added to `~/.ssh/config` automatically               |
| **Defaults**            | `--user` and `--key` flags applied to all synced hosts                     |

| **Auth: Azure**         | `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` + Azure SDK auth (env, CLI, managed identity)      |

### Theming & Safety

| Capability          | Description                                                                 |

| **Hardened defaults**   | `BatchMode=yes`, `--` anti-injection delimiter, permission checks, sensitive key filtering |

## Security & Reliability

SSM is designed for people who operate production infrastructure:

- No agents or software installed on remote servers
- SSH config permissions are checked and warned about
- Sensitive keys (`IdentityFile`, `ProxyCommand`, etc.) are filtered from the inspector
- All remote command and SFTP connections use `BatchMode=yes` and the `--` delimiter
- Stderr is sanitized and truncated
- Ping uses ordinary TCP connects — no raw sockets or privileges required

## Installation

The fastest way

If you’re using SSM in production or at scale, I’d love to hear about it.
